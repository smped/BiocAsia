# Abstract

Visualizations, especially of dimension reductions, are the workhorse of all single cell RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data analyses. Currently employed visualization techniques struggle with the scale and sparsity of scRNA-seq data with sometimes disastrous consequences, such as masking or overrepresenting cells expressing a marker genes. To address this we developed the R package schex, which allows users to produce hexgonal binning representations for dimension reductions of scRNA-seq data stored in Seurat or SingleCellExperiment objects. Hexagonal binning representations, which summarize neighbouring points into hexagons, are a widely used technique when plotting extremely large datasets. We demonstrate that they can lead to more accurate plots that are at the same time faster and require less storage than traditional plots. This increase in speed of plotting also makes them especially suited towards interactive visualizations. Finally, we showcase some of schexâ€™s new capabilities that allow plotting of different modalities as well as interactions between modalities.
