# Summary

I make the package requirements as below. 
One of them as a dependency on `rgl` which has a whole lot of system dependencies.
I tested on my system & fixed it with OpenGL via a shortcut:

```
sudo apt install libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev mesa-common-dev
```

```
pkgs <- c(
    "cluster", "survival", "randomForest", "missForest", "glmnet", "Rcpp", 
    "foreach", "itertools", "iterators", "Matrix", "devtools", "impute",
    "WangLab-MSSM/DreamAI/Code", "PengyiYang/PhosR", "directPA", "ClueR", 
    "Bioconductor/BiocIntro", "usethis", "roxygen2", "devtools", "goodpractice",
    "BiocCheck", "ExperimentHub", "CATALYST", "diffcyt", "sa-lee/fluentGenomics", 
    "workflowr", "ICC", "clustree", "HDCytoData"
    )
BiocManager::install(pkgs)
```

# Friday

## Helena Crowell: Differential discovery in high-dimensional cytometry data

- Package Requirements:
    - ExperimentHub, CATALYST, diffcyt
- Data Requirements
    - It looks like her material downloads on the fly. The main material is here: https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/CATALYST/inst/doc/differential_analysis.html
    
## Stuart Lee: Fluent genomics: a plyranges and tximeta case-study

- Package Requirements:
    - https://github.com/sa-lee/fluentGenomics
- He's done his as a package, so I tihnk loading that will cover everything. His session is here: https://sa-lee.github.io/fluentGenomics/articles/fluentGenomics.html

## Dave Tang: Reproducible bioinformatics

- Dave wants to run everything locally, but I think having a contingency plan is wise:
- Package Requirements:
    - workflowr
